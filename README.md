CHUGGR is a social sports and event betting platform that uses challenges as currency. The app makes extensive use of Googleâ€™s Firebase platform to allow for social user interaction across the platform.

Through building CHUGGR as an independent side project, I developed the following skills:

* UIKit/Swift
* MVVM and Coordinator architectures
* Unit testing, dependency injection, mock objects
* Firebase Firestore NoSQL database for bet and message storage
* Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
* Node.js Firebase Cloud Functions for backend notification management
* Git version control, branching, and rebasing
* App prototyping in Figma
* Clear communication of data model and changes with friend who is developing the CHUGGR web app.
* Shipping of app to over fifteen users via ad-hoc Safari over-the-air distribution

The [web app repo](https://github.com/mooch3/CHUGGR) is also available on GitHub.
