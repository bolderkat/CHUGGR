CHUGGR is a social sports and event betting platform that uses challenges as currency. It makes extensive use of Googleâ€™s Firebase platform to allow for social user interaction across the platform.

Through building CHUGGR as an independent side project, I developed the following skills:

* Full app design process from prototyping in Figma to implementation with UIKit/Swift
* Use of MVVM and Coordinator patterns
* Unit testing, dependency injection, mock objects
* Git version control, branching, and rebasing
* Firebase Firestore NoSQL database for bet and message storage
* Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
* Node.js Firebase Cloud Functions for backend notification management
* Shipping of app to over fifteen users via ad-hoc Safari over-the-air distribution
* Cclear communication of data models and backend changes with friend who is developing the web app version of CHUGGR.
